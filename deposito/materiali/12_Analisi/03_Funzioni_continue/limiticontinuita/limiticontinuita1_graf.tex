% 
% PGF 3.0 introduces `pic`, a "short picture" which can be inserted
% in any place of a tikzpicture.
% 
% From the manual: A âpicâ is a âshort pictureâ (hence the short name...) that
% can be inserted anywhere in TikZ picture where you could also insert a node.
% Similarly to nodes, pics have a âshapeâ (called `type` to avoid confusion) that
% someone has defined. Each time a pic of a specified type is used, the typeâs
% code is executed, resulting in some drawings to be added to the current picture.
% The syntax for adding nodes and adding pics to a picture are also very similar.
% The core difference is that pics are typically more complex than nodes and may
% consist of a whole bunch of nodes themselves together with complex paths
% joining them.
% 
% Here we use the pic feature for drawing a tree several times.
% 
% The code was written by Kate and Ignasi and published on TeX.SE.

% \usetikzlibrary{decorations.pathmorphing,calc,shapes,shapes.geometric,patterns}
% \tikzset{
%   treetop/.style = {decoration={random steps, segment length=0.4mm}, decorate},
%   trunk/.style   = {decoration={random steps, segment length=2mm,
%                     amplitude=0.2mm}, decorate}}
% 
% \tikzset{
%    my tree/.pic={
%      \foreach \w/\f in {0.3/30,0.2/50,0.1/70} {
%        \fill [brown!\f!black, trunk] (-\w/2,0) rectangle +(\w,3);

%      \foreach \n/\f in {1.4/40,1.2/50,1/60,0.8/70,0.6/80,0.4/90} {
